This folder contains material of the following paper (accepted with minor corrections, available soon):

"On the Stability of Feature Selection.". Nogueira, Sechidis and Brown. Journal of Machine Learning Reasearch (JMLR). 2017.
More specifically, it includes:

a Python 3 package called stability (given as a folder called "stability" containing the __init__.py file). The package includes all tools of the paper, including the functions to compute: 
- stability estimates 
- the variance of the estimates 
- confidence intervals for the population stability
- A hypothesis test allowing to compare the population stabilities of two feature selection procedures 
- A hypothesis test to check whether a population stability is greater than a given threshold

a DEMO using the package showing how to use this package and providing illustratating its use on real-data scenarios. You can download the the Jupyter Notebook (stabilityDemo.ipynb) or you can otherwise view it at: http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~nogueirs/stabilityDemo.html
