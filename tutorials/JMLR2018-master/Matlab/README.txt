The following files contain functions to compute the stability estimate, its variance, the confidence intervals and the two hypothesis tests presented in the paper:

getPopStab.m
getStabilityConfidenceIntervals.m
getStabilityEstimate.m
getStabilityVariance.m
getVStatistic.m
getTStatistic.m

These can be re-used in other works and take as input the binary matrix of size M*d where M is the number of feature sets and d is the total number of features.

The remaining files are the experiments of Section 7.1 of the paper, using LASSO and elastic net.
